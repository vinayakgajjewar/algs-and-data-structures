// A stack is a common data structure that represents things that need to be maintained in a specific order
// When a function calls another function, which then calls a third function,
// it is important that the third function returns to the second function rather than the first
// You can think about it like the functions being stacked on top of each other
// The last one added to the stack is the first one taken off
// The "call stack" is the term for the list of functions either executing or waiting for other functions to finish
// Push: To add an element onto the stack
// Pop: To remove an element from the stack
// Peek: To look at elements in the stack without removing them
// LIFO: Last-in, first-out
// FILO: Equivalent to LIFO, first-in, last-out
