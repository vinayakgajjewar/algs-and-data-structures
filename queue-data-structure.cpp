// Queues, like stacks, have restrictions on where you can add and remove elements
// Queues are like a cafeteria line: the person in the front is served first and people are added to the back of the line
// FIFO: First-in, first-out
// Enqueue: the addition of an element to a queue
// Dequeue: removing an element from a queue
